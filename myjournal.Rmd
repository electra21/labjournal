"Does female researchersâ€™ social network, in the Science department, include more male academics when the faculty board is gender balanced rather than male-dominated?"

There is a gender gap in STEM studies due to traditional gender roles, stereotypes and gender inequality. As a result fewer women decide to follow these studies and it is much harder for them according to literature() to advance. In this research we focus on these women's social network. it seems that when is male dominated male tend to collaborate with men. will be something diffrent if it's gender neutral? 
as a sample I will use the faculty of scinece of Utrecth uni and Radboud the former is gender neutral and the other male dominated. I will take at least one female worker from each uni and compare.
